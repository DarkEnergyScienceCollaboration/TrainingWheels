# Training Wheels

A one-stop shop for all your gravitational lens finding robot's training needs

The idea is to host a simple website where people interested in lens-finding in optical image surveys can come and find "standard sets" of training data. Links will take you to the relevant project websites, that we are happy to adveryize - and over time, we'll add our own simulated LSST data.
